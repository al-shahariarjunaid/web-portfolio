            <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes...</p>

            <h2> Big Dream</h2>
            <h3>Become A Good Developer</h3>
            <p> Everyone has a dream in his life which they want to achieve when they grow up. Some kids want to become rich so that they can buy anything and some want to be a doctor, lawyer, or engineer. But only you know that for achieving these goals you have to work hard and stay attentive to it.</p>

            <p>I say, there is no perfect way to learn. Whatever anyone recommends, check it out. If you like it, continue. If you don’t like it, Google it or search on YouTube or any mobile app store and find other ways to learn. Once you have tried out multiple ways for a few weeks, you will find out your own way to learn. So, don’t try to fit hard on other’s way, instead, build your own way to learn. That way, you will learn better!</p>

            <p>Everyone will have a different opinion. Some people will try to discourage you. Don’t get frustrated or demotivated with that. Instead, take the positive advice, trash the negative one and move forward. Keep doing what you should do. Keep learning. Keep trying. I know you can do it. So, let’s do it.</p>
